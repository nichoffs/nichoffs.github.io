# What is PySr?

A library for symbolic regression made by one of my favorite researchers, Miles Cranmer.
The backend genetic algorithm(optimization method for finding symbolic expression) runs on Julia, so it's really fast. It's also extremely flexible.

## Running PySr

I'm going to use a Jupyter notebook for all my PySr experiments.
