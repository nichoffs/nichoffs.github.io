# What is symbolic distillation?

Symbolic distillation is a technique pioneered by Miles Cranmer to improve interpretability of neural networks using symbolic regression. The basic premise is to approximate various components of a neural network by applying symbolic regression to different parts. These parts can then be substituted for the original network.
